Full experiment ran, we got some interesting results however everything tend to become an orbium, probably due to poor crossover/ mutation function.
Should ask claus more about that.
The fitness function is probably also causing some issues as ist not very advanced, thus privileging weird stuff.
Edge velocity is not a problem as we mesuring center of mass velocity. -> maybe to revisit, simplifying this that way may cause some issues.

#TODO:
Bombarding elites with a glider to test reflectors capabilities. probability that the current elites are -> approx 1-2%
Once we can prove that they are  not reflectors we should go back and redo fitness and mutation crossover functions to get new results.

#Ideas
Bigger pop may bring more spontaneous findings.

because our sample popupaltion is so small we struggle to find valuable data. and so we need to change our approach

Change encoding to HyperNEAT method, for experiment purpose
